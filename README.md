Internet of Service (IOS) is a next-generate block-chain paradigm
designed to provide high scalablilyt and mass throughput.

This repo is a prototype of IOS using DPOS-PBFT consensus module,

This reop also provides an rough implementation of Distributed
Randomness Protocol (DRP), Efficient Distributed Sharding (EDS) system.
